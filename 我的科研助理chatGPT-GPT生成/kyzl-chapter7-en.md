The following is an analysis of the two interview records using discourse analysis. This analysis is based on the study question: "Does the doctor's authority in their discourse differ between institutional and family settings?" We examine the power dynamics, identities, social norms, values, and ideologies reflected in the language of the doctor and patients in both scenarios.

### 1. Power Dynamics
- **Institutional Setting (Doctor and Patient 1)**: The power dynamics are evident through the doctor’s authoritative questioning and control of the conversation. The doctor frequently leads the dialogue with clear, directive questions, such as “How long has this been going on?” and “When does the itching get worse?” This demonstrates a strong hierarchical power, where the doctor dictates the pace and flow of the interaction.
- **Family Setting (Doctor and Grandmother)**: In contrast, the power dynamic here is less rigid. The doctor, who is also the grandson, uses more informal and conversational language, such as "You know what I mean?" and "Okay, Grandma." This creates a more relaxed atmosphere, where the grandmother holds some conversational authority, and the relationship is less strictly professional.

### 2. Identity Construction
- **Institutional Setting**: The doctor maintains a professional identity, using formal language like “We call this pruritus” and “This is a common problem in the elderly.” The patient, on the other hand, adopts the identity of a patient seeking relief, using emotional expressions such as "I just hope there’s something that can help me."
- **Family Setting**: The doctor’s identity is more personal, as he addresses his grandmother in a casual manner, which conveys care and familiarity. The grandmother’s identity, on the other hand, is more of a family member, experiencing health issues but in a much less clinical context.

### 3. Social Norms and Values
- **Institutional Setting**: The doctor’s language reflects a professional value of objectivity and care, with the aim of diagnosing and offering treatment. Phrases like “We need to manage this itching-scratching cycle” and “This is a common problem” reflect a focus on treatment and understanding medical conditions.
- **Family Setting**: The language reflects family care norms. The doctor uses more empathetic and supportive language such as “I’m sorry” and “This must be so difficult.” The grandmother’s response shows the values of familial concern and informal caregiving.

### 4. Ideology
- **Institutional Setting**: The doctor’s discourse suggests a medical ideology focused on diagnosing, explaining, and offering solutions. The doctor is seen as the authority, controlling the information flow and guiding the conversation with medical facts.
- **Family Setting**: Here, the doctor’s language is more about emotional support and maintaining a personal relationship. The ideology is more about family care, with less focus on medical facts and more on emotional comfort and connection.

### 5. Contextual Influence
- **Institutional Setting**: The formal medical context influences the doctor to speak with precision and authority, focusing on medical conditions and treatment. The patient’s responses are more focused on explaining symptoms and seeking help.
- **Family Setting**: The family setting allows for more casual, relaxed discourse. The informal nature of the conversation results in a language use that is more focused on emotional support, making the power dynamics less overt.

### 6. Other Themes or Patterns
- **Institutional Setting**: There is a noticeable emotional distance between the doctor and the patient. The doctor is more focused on the diagnosis and providing medical advice.
- **Family Setting**: Emotional connection is central in the conversation. The doctor balances medical knowledge with empathy, which softens the power difference compared to the institutional setting.

### Conclusion
In the institutional setting, the doctor’s language is authoritative, focused on diagnosis and medical explanations, maintaining a clear power structure. In contrast, in the family setting, the doctor’s language is more empathetic, informal, and supportive, with a less hierarchical power dynamic. These differences highlight how the context shapes the discourse and the doctor-patient relationship. The study reveals that the authority of the doctor’s discourse is more pronounced in institutional settings than in familial settings, where personal relationships allow for a more egalitarian dialogue.
